  # For the control planes, at least three nodes are the minimum for HA. Otherwise, you need to turn off the automatic upgrade (see ReadMe).
  # As per Rancher docs, it must always be an odd number, never even! See https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/installation/ha-embedded/
  # For instance, one is ok (non-HA), two is not ok, and three is ok (becomes HA). It does not matter if they are in the same nodepool or not! So they can be in different locations and of various types.

  # Of course, you can choose any number of nodepools you want, with the location you want. The only constraint on the location is that you need to stay in the same network region, Europe, or the US.
  # For the server type, the minimum instance supported is cpx11 (just a few cents more than cx11); see https://www.hetzner.com/cloud.

  # IMPORTANT: Before you create your cluster, you can do anything you want with the nodepools, but you need at least one of each control plane and agent.
  # Once the cluster is up and running, you can change nodepool count and even set it to 0 (in the case of the first control-plane nodepool, the minimum is 1),
  # you can also rename it (if the count is 0), but do not remove a nodepool from the list.

  # The only nodepools that are safe to remove from the list when you edit it are at the end of the lists. That is due to how subnets and IPs get allocated (FILO).
  # You can, however, freely add other nodepools at the end of each list if you want! The maximum number of nodepools you can create combined for both lists is 255.
  # Also, before decreasing the count of any nodepools to 0, it's essential to drain and cordon the nodes in question. Otherwise, it will leave your cluster in a bad state.

  # Before initializing the cluster, you can change all parameters and add or remove any nodepools. You need at least one nodepool of each kind, control plane, and agent.
  # The nodepool names are entirely arbitrary, you can choose whatever you want, but no special characters or underscore, and they must be unique; only alphanumeric characters and dashes are allowed.

  # If you want to have a single node cluster, have one control plane nodepools with a count of 1, and one agent nodepool with a count of 0.
  
  # Please note that changing labels and taints after the first run will have no effect. If needed, you will need to do that through Kubernetes directly.
